# Thinkfast! (Trivia Game)

Thinkfast! is a trivia game where users must think quickly and choose the correct answer before the timer runs out. Players can select from various question categories and difficulty levels — easy, medium, or hard — based on their preference. 

I created this project to challenge my friends and family to see who has the higher IQ. Additionally, I wanted to deepen my understanding of REST APIs and how to integrate them into a web application.

To retrieve trivia questions and answers, I used the open[**trivia database API**](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). 

Since the game consists of only one page, I implemented client-side rendering using JavaScript DOM manipulation and CSS.
